IFNITY RENDERING ENGINE TOOL 

IFNITY is a tool designed for real-time rendering and rapid prototyping of models. What sets it apart from other engines is its unique ability to switch between OpenGL, Vulkan, and DirectX 12 during runtime, with upcoming support for WebGPU. This flexibility allows for seamless transitions and experimentation across different graphics APIs without the need to restart or recompile the project.
